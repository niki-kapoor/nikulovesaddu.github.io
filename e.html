I love you so incredibly much addu,
I know it was all too cheesy and cringe and nothing reall special 
but i just wanted to do This.
Addz I wanna tell you something very IMPORTANT!
I love you very much and  i am very sorry 
for the things i do which make you upset,
i dont ever want to make you feel disrespected or bad
about yourself.
I will do everything i can to be better.
I hope you know that you deserve the best, And i am far 
from that but i will try every second to be better.
I really hope you can forgive me.
All the best for your gig babe!!
 You are gonna do amazing, I am always there with you!
  You are the most confident person i know! You are gonna slay this! Muahhhhhhs
  If you get nervous, just imagine me being there
  sipping on my cold coffee, adoring you.
  Forever and always,
  Yours,
  Jigyasa.
